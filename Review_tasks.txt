    Paper draft
        Introduction:
            literature review
            Why do this anyway
        Methodolgy: 
            Theory of the model
        Results:
            Pressure distribution results 
            Normal force results
            Tangential force results
            Hysterisis results
            Comparison with kurb strike data
            Comparison with literature 
        Conclusion
    Presentation:
        Review of the past
        Literature review
        Methodology
        Results and kurb strike results 
        Validation plan 
        3D model plan
        Timeline
    Development:
        Pressure calculation scheme
        Hysterisis scheme
        Tangential force scheme
        Terrain pre processing
        Contact tracking

Friday:

Saturday: 
    Implement Contact tracking properly:
        when finished, the results should be exactly the same as recalculating the contact at every time step, but contact objects will have memory
    implement pressure distribution 
        The formula is calculated, just type it in.
    Process some of the curb strike data and find usefull things
Sunday:
    write literature review for draft. 
    Write down some of the results and make some plots 
Monday:
    Start on tangential force and driven wheel
        Lay down the scheme for longitudinal force and start implementation
        Discuss extension to lateral force
    Write Methodology
Tuesday:
