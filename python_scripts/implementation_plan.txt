Create classes tyre, tyre node and road 
implement penetration detection with:
    multiple contacts
    a centre node for each contact
    fore and aft boundary for each contact

Before Force: 
    Remove the step where iterate through the contact nodes to find contact limits
    and do it in pre processing by pre calculating curvature radius of every point (already done)
    and assuming the length of contact to be proportional to that. 

Force: 
    In theory, show whta the error would be like if we 
    take only three points of a curve, namely:
        peak; closest point to the centre of the tyre. dr/dtheta is zero and ddr/dtheta is positive
        separation points; the fore and aft point of the contact patches
    and use those points to estimate the pressure distribution of the contact but assuming force at any point in the contact to be proportional to the amount of radial deflecition
    
    for 3D: 
        in preprocessing, find the gradiant of the normals of the surface at every point
        filter using the neighbour list method
        using the same neighbour list, 

Add a quarter car model on top of it to test.
